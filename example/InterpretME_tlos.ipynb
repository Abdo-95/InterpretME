The KG of the *French Royalty Benchmark* is a fully curated subset of DBpedia; for each person we added the class `dbo:Person` as well as different properties like the number of children or predecessors, and further triple related counts. Here, the predictive task is a binary classification to predict whether a person has a spouse. The statistics of the *French Royalty KG* are presented in the following:"
